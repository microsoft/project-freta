# Project Freta

## Summary

The `Freta library for Python` enables access to [Project Freta](https://freta.azurewebsites.net), a service used to inspect volatile memory images.

Included in this library is a utility, `freta`, which provides command line access to the [Project Freta](https://freta.azurewebsites.net) service.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6 ad 3.7 are fully supported and tested.  Other versions may work, but are untested.

## Installing
To install, use `pip`

```bash
pip install .
```

## Using the Client

{
    "lime": "LiME image",
    "raw": "Raw Physical Memory Dump",
    "vmrs": "Hyper-V Memory Snapshot"
}
$ freta image upload "my first image" lime eastus ./image.lime
{
    "image_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "owner_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
$
```

## Using the API

```python
import json
from freta import Freta

freta = Freta()
response = freta.formats():
print(json.dumps(response, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
response = freta.image.upload("my first image", "lime", "eastus", "./image.lime")
print(json.dumps(response, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
```

## Local Development

Development within a virtual environment is recommended

    # setup virtual environment
    python3 -m venv ~/freta-venv
    source ~/freta-venv/bin/activate

    # install dev prereqs
    python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    python -m pip install -e .

## Testing

As provided from source, tests are verified against pre-recorded API interactins recorded using [pyvcr](https://pypi.org/project/vcrpy/).

    # Run unit tests
    pytest

To test against the live API:

    # Delete recorded API sessions
    rm tests/fixtures/*
    
    # Use the API to ensure you're logged in
    freta regions

    # Run unit tests
    pytest
